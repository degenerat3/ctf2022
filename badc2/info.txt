Only thing included in the challenge should be the pcap located in `challenge/cap.pacp`, with the name/description above. The scripts are there as a reference for admin only, they are NOT for competitors to see.

If people ask, YES sending a POST request to maliciouspayload[.]delivery is allowed and encouraged, as that's how the challenge is solved (more info in writeup).
